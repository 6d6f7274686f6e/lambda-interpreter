Lambda Calculus Interpreter
---------------------------

RULES:
 - Variable names are 1 character long and can be anything 
  except the following:
    * Numbers
    * Underscore ('_')
    * Parenthesis
    * Backslash ('\')    
    * Space (' ')
 - Variable names can be surrounded by parenthesis: (v) or v
 - When encoutering an ambiguous case, the interpreter will try to rename 
  variables by adding a number after them:
    * (\xx.x) is equivalent to (\x.(\x.x))
     The second lambda definition shadows the first, so the compiler will
     evaluate this to (\xx_1.x)
    * (\xy.x y) y will evaluate to (\y_1.y y_1)
 - Functions should be preferably surrounded by parenthesis if you want to
  avoid headaches:
    * \v.E will work, but..
    * \v.E x is equivalent to \v.(E x) and not to (\v.E) x
 - There can be multiple parameters for a function definition:
    * (\x.(\y.x)) is correct
    * (\\xy.x) is correct and equivalent to the above
 - Application is done with spaces: (E1 E2)
 - There can be multiple arguments for the same application:
    * ((E1 v) w) is correct
    * (E1 v w) is correct and equivalent to the above

ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:
 - :quit or :q will quit the interpreter.
 - :help or :h will show this help message.
 - :cls or :clear will clear the console.
